Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals
are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side
length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first
falls below 10%?
